        <p>In the interest of full transparency and in compliance with global trade commission guidelines, HISABIFY discloses that we may occasionally recommend books, software, or services that we believe add value to our users. While our primary mission is educational:</p>
        <p>We may receive a small commission if you choose to purchase a product through certain links on this site. This comes at no additional cost to you.

        <p>Your religious obligations (Zakat) and your civil obligations (Taxes) are distinct. Fulfilling a calculation on HISABIFY does not satisfy legal tax filing requirements in your country of residence. Always consult with a licensed professional in your specific region before making significant financial commitments.</p>
