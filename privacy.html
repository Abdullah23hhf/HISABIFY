<div class="content-wrap">
    <h3>Introduction and Purpose</h3>
    <p>At <strong>HISABIFY</strong>, accessible from our portal, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document details the types of information collected and recorded by HISABIFY and how we utilize it to maintain a safe, educational, and transparent environment for all users.</p>
    
    <p>This policy applies to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website regarding the information that they shared and/or collect in HISABIFY. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        "We believe in financial transparency and data sovereignty. Your calculations are your own; we never store your personal wealth data on our servers. Integrity and trust are the cornerstones of our service."
    </div>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect and Process</h3>
    <p>HISABIFY follows a strict "Local-Processing" model. When you use our Zakat calculators, the data you enter (such as gold weight, cash amounts, or crypto holdings) is processed locally on your device's browser. We do not transmit or store this sensitive financial information on our databases. We may collect information through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Communication:</strong> If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, the contents of the message, and any attachments you may send us.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If we implement registration features, we may ask for contact information, including items such as name, company name, address, email address, and telephone number.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Purpose of Privacy Policy (Educational Use)</h3>
    <p>The primary purpose of this website is educational and informational. We collect data solely to facilitate the user experience, improve our educational resources, and ensure the technical stability of the platform. We do not engage in the sale of user data to third parties. Our data processing activities are focused on providing accurate Shariah-compliant calculations and high-authority research content for the global community.</p>

    <h3>3. Advertising & Google AdSense Data Usage</h3>
    <p>HISABIFY may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on HISABIFY. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to HISABIFY and other sites on the Internet.</p>
    <p>Ad networks use technologies like cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons that are used in their respective advertisements and links that appear on HISABIFY, which are sent directly to users' browsers. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. These technologies are used to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see on websites that you visit.</p>

    <h3>4. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Third-Party Technologies</h3>

    <h3>5. Log Files & Technical Data Transparency</h3>
    <p>HISABIFY follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this as part of hosting services' analytics.

These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.</p>

    <h3>6. International Users & Cross-Border Compliance</h3>
    <p>HISABIFY operates globally and adheres to international standards of data protection. If you are visiting from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to our hosting facilities, which may be located in a different jurisdiction. We ensure that such transfers are protected by appropriate safeguards to maintain the integrity of your data.</p>

    <h3>7. Children’s Information (COPPA Compliance)</h3>
    <p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>
    <p>HISABIFY does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records. Our content is designed for a general audience interested in financial education.</p>
